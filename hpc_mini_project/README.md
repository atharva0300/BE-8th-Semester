## Project Title
Implement Sparse Matrix Multiplication using CUDA

## Suggestions for improvement
1. Take dynamic inputs
2. Sparse × sparse multiplication and not sparse × dense 
3. Output should also be sparse
4. Increase the size of the matrix ( 20 × 20 matrix atleast ) 
5. Show the reduction in the no. Of operations 
6. Read the input from a file
7. More number of blocks
8. Compute for CPU and GPU and compare the time required
