Pertamina harus tanggung jawab,\" kata dia dalam keterangan di Jakarta Sabtu, 4 Maret 2024.Rofik mengatakan Pertamina serta pihak terkait harus memastikan keselamatan dan keamanan warga yang tinggal di sekitar lokasi.Pipa BBM yang terbakar itu merupakan bagian dari Terminal Bahan Bakar Minyak (TBBM) Plumpang. TBBM Plumpang dinilai sebagai salah satu terminal BBM terpenting di Indonesia, sehingga Rofik juga menegaskan Pertamina harus memastikan pasokan bahan bakar minyak tetap aman meski ada insiden tersebut.\"Plumpang menyuplai sekitar 20 persen kebutuhan BBM harian di Indonesia, atau sekitar 25 persen dari total kebutuhan SPBU Pertamina. Maka tindakan selanjutnya adalah bagaimana memastikan suplai BBM tidak terganggu,\" katanya.Rofik juga menyinggung kejadian kilang minyak milik Pertamina yang sebelumnya pernah terjadi kejadian serupa, seperti Kilang Balikpapan pada Maret 2022 lalu. Terhitung 2 tahun terakhir ini, kata dia, sudah 5 fasilitas migas milik Pertamina mengalami insiden kebakaran.\"Menyayangkan terjadinya musibah kebakaran ini, apalagi insiden kebakaran bukan kali pertama di fasilitas migas, ini terus berulang. Pertamina harus benahi sistem pengamanan dan SOP yang ada,\" kata dia.Rofik mengharapkan adanya pembenahan menyeluruh terhadap sistem pengamanan serta SOP yang ada dalam lingkup Pertamina untuk mengamankan baik fasilitas migas, pekerja, maupun masyarakat sekitar. Menurutnya pembenahan diperlukan agar Pertamina tidak abai terhadap aspek pengamanan fasilitas migas.\"Investigasi menyeluruh dan tuntas, serta meminta komitmen Pertamina memperbaiki sistem keamanan kilang minyak maupun depo BBM, seringnya kebakaran terjadi mengindikasikan Pertamina abai terhadap pengamanan kilang,\" ujarnya.Pilihan Editor:Profil Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Pemasok 20 Persen Pasokan BBM di Seluruh Indonesia   \n",

M. Hidayat Nur Wahid MA., atau HNW menerima kunjungan perwakilan korban kasus biro perjalanan Haji dan Umroh First Travel, yang tergabung dalam Paguyuban First Travel Indonesia. Pertemuan tersebut berlangsung di Ruang Kerja Wakil Ketua MPR Gedung Nusantara III Komplek Senayan, Jumat, 3 Maret 2023.Delegasi Paguyuban First Travel Indonesia dipimpin Abdul Rasyid SIQ, S. Thi, M.Si., Salah satu tujuan Kedatangan perwakilan mereka bertemu HNW, adalah untuk meminta bantuan dan dukungan terkait Putusan Kasasi Mahkamah Agung Nomor: 365 PK/Pid.Sus/2022 tanggal 23 Mei 2022.Dalam PK, itu Mahkamah Agung (MA) memutuskan bahwa seluruh aset dalam kasus PT First Anugerah Karya Wisata (First Travel) dikembalikan ke jamaah atau korban. Tapi, hingga kini keputusan tersebut belum bisa dieksekusi.Bahkan, Kejaksaan Negeri (Kejari) Depok selaku eksekutor tengah menunggu putusan lengkap Peninjauan Kembali (PK) perkara tersebut. Kepada HNW, Abdul Rasyid mengatakan, para calon jamaah Umroh berharap bisa diberangkatkan ke tanah suci Mekah untuk melaksanakan Ibadah Umroh.\"Keberangkatan ke Mekah, lebih penting dibanding menerima pengembalian biaya umroh yang telah kami bayarkan pada 2016-2017,\" kata Abdul.Ia berharap, pemerintah dalam hal ini kementerian agama membantu calon jamaah Umroh. Kami berharap pemerintah hadir dalam perkara ini, dan bertanggungjawab memberangkatkan seluruh jamaah umroh korban first Travel, sebagaimana pernah mereka janjikan, ujar Abdul.Wakil Ketua MPR Hidayat Nur Wahid menyampaikan rasa prihatin dan ikut bersimpati terhadap jamaah umroh yang gagal diberangkatkan biro perjalanan Haji dan Umroh First Travel. HNW memahami, betapa kecewa dan sedihnya jamaah yang gagal diberangkatkan.Apalagi, tidak sedikit diantara mereka yang menabung selama bertahun-tahun, mengumpulkan uang untuk membayar biaya umroh. Persoalan Umroh, menurut HNW kerap dibahas oleh Komisi VIII DPR RI dengan pihak Kementerian Agama.Bahkan, untuk menjamin agar ibadah umroh bisa berjalan dengan baik, Komisi VIII mengusulkan selain adanya Dirjen Penyelenggaraan Haji juga Umroh. Sayangnya persoalan haji lebih mendapat perhatian dibanding ibadah Umroh.Ini memang belum adil, pemerintah masih memberikan perhatiannya lebih besar kepada persoalan haji dari pada persoalan calon jemaah Umroh, kata HNW.Hidayat mendukung calon jamaah Umroh yang tergabung dalam Paguyuban First Travel Indonesia, tetap berusaha menuntut haknya agar bisa melaksanakan ibadah umroh. Apalagi, mereka pernah dijanjikan oleh Kementerian Agama, untuk diberangkatkan Umroh jika persoalan hukumnya telah inkracht.Perwakilan calon jemaah Umroh pun menyampaikan apresiasi dan terimakasih kepada HNW dengan berbagai saran konstruktif dan kesediaannya membantu para calon jemaah umroh.

              "4      INFO NASIONAL - Ketua MPR RI sekaligus Ketua Umum Ikatan Motor Indonesia (IMI) dan Wakil Ketua Umum Partai Golkar Bambang Soesatyo diangkat sebagai Ketua Dewan Pembina Harley Davidson Club Indonesia (HDCI) periode 2023-2028.Bamsoet berharap HDCI akan tetap konsisten mempertahankan citra positif yang telah dibangun. Sehingga, dapat menginspirasi klub-klub otomotif lainnya untuk memberikan kontribusi terbaik bagi kehidupan sosial kemasyarakatan.\"Selamat kepada sahabat saya Ahmad Sahroni yang telah terpilih sebagai Ketua Umum HDCI periode 2023-2028 pada Musyawarah Nasional Luar Biasa tanggal 27-28 Januari 2023 di Bali,\" kata Bamsoet saat membuka Rapat Kerja Nasional (Rakernas) HDCI dan pelantikan pengurus pusat HDCI periode 2023-2028 di Semarang, Jumat malam, 3 Maret 2023.Bamsoet yakin dan percaya dengan pengalaman dan wawasan organisasi yang luas, kemampuan membangun networking yang handal, serta kecintaan yang tulus pada dunia otomotif, Ahmad Sahroni memiliki segala kualifikasi. \"Dan kompetensi yang dibutuhkan untuk memimpin dan memajukan organisasi HDCI,\" ujar Bamsoet.Hadir antara lain Ketua Umum HDCI Ahmad Sahroni, Kakorlantas Polri Irjen Pol. Firman Santyabudi, Wakapolda Jawa Tengah Brigjen Pol. Abiyoso Seno Aji, Dirjen Administrasi Hukum Umum Kemenkumham Cahyo Rahadian Muzhar, Kajati DKI Jakarta Reda Manthovani dan Kajati Jawa Tengah I Made Suarnawan.Ketua DPR RI ke-20 dan mantan Ketua Komisi III DPR RI bidang Hukum, HAM, dan Keamanan ini menjelaskan, sejak didirikan pada 28 Mei 1990, HDCI terus tumbuh dan berkembang hingga memiliki puluhan ribu anggota yang tersebar di seluruh wilayah nusantara. Namun, HDCI 'besar' bukan hanya karena jumlah anggotanya.Tapi, karena kiprah dan kontribusinya dalam kehidupan masyarakat, khususnya melalui berbagai aksi sosial kemanusiaan yang diprakarsainya. \"Pada berbagai event yang diselenggarakan oleh HDCI, hampir selalu dibarengi dengan agenda bakti sosial. Bahkan pada acara pelantikan pengurus dan Rakernas kali ini, juga disertai dengan pemberian tanda kasih bagi ribuan anak yatim,\" kata Bamsoet.Wakil Ketua Umum Partai Golkar dan Kepala Badan Hubungan Penegakan Hukum, Pertahanan dan Keamanan KADIN Indonesia ini mengatakan, kiprah positif HDCI tidak hanya dirasakan dari maraknya berbagai aksi sosial yang dilakukan. Tetapi, juga pada keberpihakan dan dukungan HDCI untuk memajukan perekonomian masyarakat.\"Salah satunya melalui implementasi konsep sport automotive tourism yang menyatukan aktivitas otomotif dengan upaya memajukan sektor pariwisata, sehingga dapat mendorong geliat perekonomian rakyat, khususnya para pelaku UMKM di daerah,\" ujar Bamsoet.Ketua Umum Pengurus Besar Keluarga Olahraga Tarung Derajat dan Wakil Ketua Umum Pemuda Pancasila menilai kiprah dan kontribusi HDCI yang telah dilakukan memiliki makna mendalam, khususnya ditengah masih adanya pandangan negatif dari sebagian masyarakat terhadap keberadaan klub motor besar. Eksistensi klub motor besar dipandang sebagai simbol eksklusivisme yang telah membentuk sekat dan kelas sosial yang membentangkan jarak dengan kelompok masyarakat lainnya.\"Karena itu, saya sangat mengapresiasi komitmen Ahmad Sahroni beserta segenap jajaran pengurus HDCI, untuk menjadikan organisasi HDCI sebagai pelayan, pelindung, dan pemersatu,\" ujarnya.Menurutnya, komitmen ini mengisyaratkan adanya semangat inklusivitas, untuk merangkul semua kalangan. \"Sekaligus jiwa solidaritas yang mengedepankan semangat kekeluargaan dan kebersamaan\".

Karena tekanan di dasar Mariana sangat tinggi dan lingkungannya gelap gulita, maka tak heran jika hewan-hewan yang hidup di sana punya wujud aneh. Berikut 5 aneh yang hidup di Palung Mariana: Hiu goblin ( ) adalah satu-satunya Mitsukurinidae yang masih hidup, berusia sekitar 125 juta tahun. Beberapa kali nelayan pernah menangkap hiu goblin. Hewan ini pertama kali dideskripsikan lebih dari 100 tahun lalu. Namun, hanya sedikit yang diketahui karena hidup di tempat yang tidak bisa dijangkau manusia. Hiu goblin memiliki sistem sensorik dikenal sebagai di moncongnya. Sistem sensorik ini dapat mendeteksi impuls listrik yang lemah di dalam air, seperti denyut nadi calon mangsa yang lewat. Ketika mangsa lewat di dekatnya, rahang hiu goblin bakal maju ke depan secara sporadis, menusuknya dengan gigi seperti jarum. Bagi kamu yang pernah nonton mungkin tak asing dengan ikan yang satu ini. pemancing mirip alien ( ) dengan umpan . Mereka memiliki bagian tubuh memanjang di kepala mirip joran dengan umpan bola kecil bisa menyala. Alat ini digunakan untuk menarik mangsa di kegelapan. Pada 2014, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) berhasil merekam penampakan ikan setan laut hitam untuk pertama kalinya. Meski terlihat menakutkan dengan gigi berduri melapisi mulutnya yang menganga, ikan ini hanya berukuran sekitar 20 centimeter saja. Jadi enggak besar kok, gaes. Dengan panjang 15 centimeter, ikan naga ( ) memiliki rahang besar mirip Venom di film Marvel. Rahang mereka mampu memanjang dan membuka melebihi kemampuan rahang ikan pada umumnya. Rahang dan mulutnya dilapisi dengan puluhan gigi taring yang tajam. Ini adalah makhluk hidup terdalam dari semua gurita. Dia adalah dumbo, bergerak dengan cara mengepakkan sirip seperti telinga dan menggunakan lengannya sebagai dayung. Mereka telah beradaptasi di lingkungan yang ekstrem dengan menjadi oportunis terakhir, karena betina akan membawa telurnya dalam berbagai tahap perkembangan. Ini artinya, jika mereka kawin, betina bisa menyimpan sperma jantan sampai kondisi lingkungan menguntungkan untuk menghasilkan keturunan. Barreleye punya bentuk fisik lumayan aneh, ia memiliki mata petet berbentuk tabung dengan kepala transparan. Mata tabung barreleye dapat berputar di dalam batok transparan yang menutupi kepalanya, memungkinkan mereka mengintai mangsa potensial atau fokus ke depan untuk melihat apa yang akan ia makan. Mata barreleye tidak hanya terlihat aneh, tetapi juga berwarna hijau. Menurut peneliti warna hijau membantu ikan menyaring sinar matahari dari permukaan. Ini juga kemungkinan membantu mereka untuk melihat cahaya bioluminescent mangsanya. Mereka menggunakan mata tubular ultra-sensitif untuk mencari siluet samar mangsa di atas kepalanya. Mata barreleye yang berbentuk tabung membuat mereka memiliki jarak pandang yang cukup sempit. Tapi uniknya, mata mereka bisa berputar. Hal inilah yang membuat ahli biologi kelautan percaya bahwa mata barreleye bisa melirik ke atas untuk melihat bayangan samar mangsa potensial, kemudian mengarahkan matanya ke depan saat ia perlahan naik untuk menemui korbannya.   \n",

Guru tersebut berinisial AR (42) warga Kelurahan Singotrunan, Banyuwangi. Kanit Renakta Satreskrim Polresta Banyuwangi, Ipda Devi mengatakan, peristiwa pencabulan ini terjadi pada Kamis (9/3) lalu. Awalnya, AR bersama para muridnya menuju ke taman atau RTH dekat sekolah untuk melaksanakan kegiatan olahraga. Kemudian, salah satu saksi warga sekitar melihat pelaku tengah menggandeng seorang siswi yang hendak menuju RTH tersebut. \"Selanjutnya saksi menanyakan kepada temannya yang sebagai guru di SDN 1 Singotrunan apakah terlapor sudah menikah lagi karena pagi tadi melihat terlapor menggandeng tangan siswa perempuan,\" kata Devi kepada , Selasa (11/4). Dua hari kemudian, saksi menceritakan apa yang ia lihat ke salah satu guru di SD tersebut. Lalu, salah satu guru SD itu memanggil seluruh siswa dan menanyakan apakah pelaku pernah memegang anggota tubuh mereka. \"Setelah itu semua siswa perempuan mengatakan pernah terlapor memegang tangan dan merangkul. Karena saat itu sudah saatnya jam pulang akhirnya saksi memulangkan para siswanya,\" jelas Devi. Usai guru itu menanyakan ke para murid perempuan, salah seorang siswi tiba-tiba mendekatinya dan memberi tahu bahwa pelaku juga pernah memegang payudaranya. Bahkan, pelaku juga pernah memperlihatkan video porno kepada siswi itu saat perjalanan dari RTH usai kegiatan olahraga. \"Selanjutnya anak korban juga menjelaskan bahwa teman lainnya juga jadi korban,\" terangnya. Devi mengungkapkan, sejumlah siswi juga pernah menjadi korban dari AR. Pada Minggu (13/4), para orang tua korban bersepakat untuk melaporkan AR ke Satreskrim Polresta Banyuwangi atas tindakan bejatnya. Devi menuturkan, salah seorang korban juga pernah diancam oleh pelaku untuk tidak menceritakan kepada siapa-siapa. \"Anak korban mengaku telah diancam oleh terlapor dengan berkata ' ' (kamu jangan bilang ke siapa-siapa kalau saya pegang seperti ini) sehingga membuat para anak korban takut,\" tuturnya. Lebih lanjut, polisi akhirnya menangkap pelaku dan menetapkan sebagai tersangka pencabulan. \"Perkara sudah kami tindak lanjuti. Sudah dilakukan penahanan terhadap tersangka,\" ujar Devi. Atas perbuatannya, tersangka dikenakan dengan Pasal 82 ayat (1) atau ayat (2) atau ayat (4) Undang-Undang RI nomor 17 tahun 2016 tentang penetapan peraturan pemerintah pengganti Undang-Undang nomor 1 tahun 2016 tentang perubahan kedua atas Undang-Undang nomor 23 tahun 2002 tentang perlindungan anak menjadi undang-undang Jo Pasal 76E Undang-Undang RI nomor 35 Tahun 2014 tentang perubahan atas Undang-Undang nomor 23 Tahun 2002 tentang perlindungan anak.   \n",

Pantauan , usai ketua majelis hakim Muhammad Iman mengetuk palu sidang, terdakwa Sugeng langsung menghampiri ibundanya yang setia menunggu jalannya sidang sejak siang hingga malam sekitar pukul 20.00 WIB. Tersangka Sugeng tampak mencium kaki ibundanya dan disambut pelukan erat dari sang ibu. Sugeng juga menghampiri istrinya yang tengah hamil besar, dia mencium perut istrinya. \"Doanya saja, semoga kebenaran bisa ditegakkan dan ada keadilan untuk saya. Saya bukan pelakunya,\" kata Sugeng. Sugeng berharap dirinya dapat menyaksikan kelahiran dan mengazani anaknya yang diprediksi dalam beberapa hari ke depan akan lahir. \"Sebagai muslim, wajib bagi seorang bapak untuk mengazani anaknya yang baru lahir. Tolong berikan kesempatan saya. Karena, saya sudah kehilangan ayah dan tidak sempat melihat penguburannya karena saya ada di dalam penjara,\" ucap Sugeng. Setelahnya terdakwa Sugeng melangkah keluar ruangan sidang dan menghampiri anak lelakinya yang tengah tertidur di kursi tunggu Pengadilan Negeri Cianjur. Saat Sugeng akan meninggalkan ruang sidang dan masuk mobil tahanan, seluruh keluarga besarnya tampak haru berpisah dengannya. Dalam sidang tersebut, tim kuasa hukum terdakwa meminta Majelis Hakim agar mengabulkan permohonan peralihan ke tahanan kota. Kuasa hukum terdakwa, Martin Simanjuntak mengungkapkan seharusnya majelis hakim dapat mengabulkan permohonan peralihan menjadi tahanan kota. \"Mengingat penjaminnya merupakan orang tua korban, ayah dari Almarhum Selvi. Apalagi yang menjadi pertimbangan majelis hakim untuk tidak mengabulkan permohonan tersebut,\" pungkas Martin.   \n",

              "      <td>TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Anggota Komisi VII DPR RI Rofik Hananto menyayangkan terjadinya insiden kebakaran yang disebabkan oleh bocornya depo Plumpang, Jakarta Utara, pada Jumat, 3 Maret 2023.\"Turut berbela sungkawa terhadap masyarakat sipil yang terdampak, apalagi ini daerah padat penduduk. Pertamina harus tanggung jawab,\" kata dia dalam keterangan di Jakarta Sabtu, 4 Maret 2024.Rofik mengatakan Pertamina serta pihak terkait harus memastikan keselamatan dan keamanan warga yang tinggal di sekitar lokasi.Pipa BBM yang terbakar itu merupakan bagian dari Terminal Bahan Bakar Minyak (TBBM) Plumpang. TBBM Plumpang dinilai sebagai salah satu terminal BBM terpenting di Indonesia, sehingga Rofik juga menegaskan Pertamina harus memastikan pasokan bahan bakar minyak tetap aman meski ada insiden tersebut.\"Plumpang menyuplai sekitar 20 persen kebutuhan BBM harian di Indonesia, atau sekitar 25 persen dari total kebutuhan SPBU Pertamina. Maka tindakan selanjutnya adalah bagaimana memastikan suplai BBM tidak terganggu,\" katanya.Rofik juga menyinggung kejadian kilang minyak milik Pertamina yang sebelumnya pernah terjadi kejadian serupa, seperti Kilang Balikpapan pada Maret 2022 lalu. Terhitung 2 tahun terakhir ini, kata dia, sudah 5 fasilitas migas milik Pertamina mengalami insiden kebakaran.\"Menyayangkan terjadinya musibah kebakaran ini, apalagi insiden kebakaran bukan kali pertama di fasilitas migas, ini terus berulang. Pertamina harus benahi sistem pengamanan dan SOP yang ada,\" kata dia.Rofik mengharapkan adanya pembenahan menyeluruh terhadap sistem pengamanan serta SOP yang ada dalam lingkup Pertamina untuk mengamankan baik fasilitas migas, pekerja, maupun masyarakat sekitar. Menurutnya pembenahan diperlukan agar Pertamina tidak abai terhadap aspek pengamanan fasilitas migas.\"Investigasi menyeluruh dan tuntas, serta meminta komitmen Pertamina memperbaiki sistem keamanan kilang minyak maupun depo BBM, seringnya kebakaran terjadi mengindikasikan Pertamina abai terhadap pengamanan kilang,\" ujarnya.Pilihan Editor:Profil Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Pemasok 20 Persen Pasokan BBM di Seluruh Indonesia</td>\n",

              "      <td>INFO NASIONAL - Wakil Ketua MPR RI Dr. H. M. Hidayat Nur Wahid MA., atau HNW menerima kunjungan perwakilan korban kasus biro perjalanan Haji dan Umroh First Travel, yang tergabung dalam Paguyuban First Travel Indonesia. Pertemuan tersebut berlangsung di Ruang Kerja Wakil Ketua MPR Gedung Nusantara III Komplek Senayan, Jumat, 3 Maret 2023.Delegasi Paguyuban First Travel Indonesia dipimpin Abdul Rasyid SIQ, S. Thi, M.Si., Salah satu tujuan Kedatangan perwakilan mereka bertemu HNW, adalah untuk meminta bantuan dan dukungan terkait Putusan Kasasi Mahkamah Agung Nomor: 365 PK/Pid.Sus/2022 tanggal 23 Mei 2022.Dalam PK, itu Mahkamah Agung (MA) memutuskan bahwa seluruh aset dalam kasus PT First Anugerah Karya Wisata (First Travel) dikembalikan ke jamaah atau korban. Tapi, hingga kini keputusan tersebut belum bisa dieksekusi.Bahkan, Kejaksaan Negeri (Kejari) Depok selaku eksekutor tengah menunggu putusan lengkap Peninjauan Kembali (PK) perkara tersebut. Kepada HNW, Abdul Rasyid mengatakan, para calon jamaah Umroh berharap bisa diberangkatkan ke tanah suci Mekah untuk melaksanakan Ibadah Umroh.\"Keberangkatan ke Mekah, lebih penting dibanding menerima pengembalian biaya umroh yang telah kami bayarkan pada 2016-2017,\" kata Abdul.Ia berharap, pemerintah dalam hal ini kementerian agama membantu calon jamaah Umroh. Kami berharap pemerintah hadir dalam perkara ini, dan bertanggungjawab memberangkatkan seluruh jamaah umroh korban first Travel, sebagaimana pernah mereka janjikan, ujar Abdul.Wakil Ketua MPR Hidayat Nur Wahid menyampaikan rasa prihatin dan ikut bersimpati terhadap jamaah umroh yang gagal diberangkatkan biro perjalanan Haji dan Umroh First Travel. HNW memahami, betapa kecewa dan sedihnya jamaah yang gagal diberangkatkan.Apalagi, tidak sedikit diantara mereka yang menabung selama bertahun-tahun, mengumpulkan uang untuk membayar biaya umroh. Persoalan Umroh, menurut HNW kerap dibahas oleh Komisi VIII DPR RI dengan pihak Kementerian Agama.Bahkan, untuk menjamin agar ibadah umroh bisa berjalan dengan baik, Komisi VIII mengusulkan selain adanya Dirjen Penyelenggaraan Haji juga Umroh. Sayangnya persoalan haji lebih mendapat perhatian dibanding ibadah Umroh.Ini memang belum adil, pemerintah masih memberikan perhatiannya lebih besar kepada persoalan haji dari pada persoalan calon jemaah Umroh, kata HNW.Hidayat mendukung calon jamaah Umroh yang tergabung dalam Paguyuban First Travel Indonesia, tetap berusaha menuntut haknya agar bisa melaksanakan ibadah umroh. Apalagi, mereka pernah dijanjikan oleh Kementerian Agama, untuk diberangkatkan Umroh jika persoalan hukumnya telah inkracht.Perwakilan calon jemaah Umroh pun menyampaikan apresiasi dan terimakasih kepada HNW dengan berbagai saran konstruktif dan kesediaannya membantu para calon jemaah umroh.

Sehingga, dapat menginspirasi klub-klub otomotif lainnya untuk memberikan kontribusi terbaik bagi kehidupan sosial kemasyarakatan.\"Selamat kepada sahabat saya Ahmad Sahroni yang telah terpilih sebagai Ketua Umum HDCI periode 2023-2028 pada Musyawarah Nasional Luar Biasa tanggal 27-28 Januari 2023 di Bali,\" kata Bamsoet saat membuka Rapat Kerja Nasional (Rakernas) HDCI dan pelantikan pengurus pusat HDCI periode 2023-2028 di Semarang, Jumat malam, 3 Maret 2023.Bamsoet yakin dan percaya dengan pengalaman dan wawasan organisasi yang luas, kemampuan membangun networking yang handal, serta kecintaan yang tulus pada dunia otomotif, Ahmad Sahroni memiliki segala kualifikasi. \"Dan kompetensi yang dibutuhkan untuk memimpin dan memajukan organisasi HDCI,\" ujar Bamsoet.Hadir antara lain Ketua Umum HDCI Ahmad Sahroni, Kakorlantas Polri Irjen Pol. Firman Santyabudi, Wakapolda Jawa Tengah Brigjen Pol. Abiyoso Seno Aji, Dirjen Administrasi Hukum Umum Kemenkumham Cahyo Rahadian Muzhar, Kajati DKI Jakarta Reda Manthovani dan Kajati Jawa Tengah I Made Suarnawan.Ketua DPR RI ke-20 dan mantan Ketua Komisi III DPR RI bidang Hukum, HAM, dan Keamanan ini menjelaskan, sejak didirikan pada 28 Mei 1990, HDCI terus tumbuh dan berkembang hingga memiliki puluhan ribu anggota yang tersebar di seluruh wilayah nusantara. Namun, HDCI 'besar' bukan hanya karena jumlah anggotanya.Tapi, karena kiprah dan kontribusinya dalam kehidupan masyarakat, khususnya melalui berbagai aksi sosial kemanusiaan yang diprakarsainya. \"Pada berbagai event yang diselenggarakan oleh HDCI, hampir selalu dibarengi dengan agenda bakti sosial. Bahkan pada acara pelantikan pengurus dan Rakernas kali ini, juga disertai dengan pemberian tanda kasih bagi ribuan anak yatim,\" kata Bamsoet.Wakil Ketua Umum Partai Golkar dan Kepala Badan Hubungan Penegakan Hukum, Pertahanan dan Keamanan KADIN Indonesia ini mengatakan, kiprah positif HDCI tidak hanya dirasakan dari maraknya berbagai aksi sosial yang dilakukan. Tetapi, juga pada keberpihakan dan dukungan HDCI untuk memajukan perekonomian masyarakat.\"Salah satunya melalui implementasi konsep sport automotive tourism yang menyatukan aktivitas otomotif dengan upaya memajukan sektor pariwisata, sehingga dapat mendorong geliat perekonomian rakyat, khususnya para pelaku UMKM di daerah,\" ujar Bamsoet.Ketua Umum Pengurus Besar Keluarga Olahraga Tarung Derajat dan Wakil Ketua Umum Pemuda Pancasila menilai kiprah dan kontribusi HDCI yang telah dilakukan memiliki makna mendalam, khususnya ditengah masih adanya pandangan negatif dari sebagian masyarakat terhadap keberadaan klub motor besar. Eksistensi klub motor besar dipandang sebagai simbol eksklusivisme yang telah membentuk sekat dan kelas sosial yang membentangkan jarak dengan kelompok masyarakat lainnya.\"Karena itu, saya sangat mengapresiasi komitmen Ahmad Sahroni beserta segenap jajaran pengurus HDCI, untuk menjadikan organisasi HDCI sebagai pelayan, pelindung, dan pemersatu,\" ujarnya.Menurutnya, komitmen ini mengisyaratkan adanya semangat inklusivitas, untuk merangkul semua kalangan. \"Sekaligus jiwa solidaritas yang mengedepankan semangat kekeluargaan dan kebersamaan\".

Ini adalah lokasi yang sangat sulit dijangkau oleh manusia sehingga masih banyak misteri yang belum terungkap di dalamnya. Namun, berkat kemajuan teknologi, peneliti mulai bisa mengungkap sedikit demi sedikit bentuk kehidupan yang ada di dasar palung tersebut. Karena tekanan di dasar Mariana sangat tinggi dan lingkungannya gelap gulita, maka tak heran jika hewan-hewan yang hidup di sana punya wujud aneh. Berikut 5 aneh yang hidup di Palung Mariana: Hiu goblin ( ) adalah satu-satunya Mitsukurinidae yang masih hidup, berusia sekitar 125 juta tahun. Beberapa kali nelayan pernah menangkap hiu goblin. Hewan ini pertama kali dideskripsikan lebih dari 100 tahun lalu. Namun, hanya sedikit yang diketahui karena hidup di tempat yang tidak bisa dijangkau manusia. Hiu goblin memiliki sistem sensorik dikenal sebagai di moncongnya. Sistem sensorik ini dapat mendeteksi impuls listrik yang lemah di dalam air, seperti denyut nadi calon mangsa yang lewat. Ketika mangsa lewat di dekatnya, rahang hiu goblin bakal maju ke depan secara sporadis, menusuknya dengan gigi seperti jarum. Bagi kamu yang pernah nonton mungkin tak asing dengan ikan yang satu ini. pemancing mirip alien ( ) dengan umpan . Mereka memiliki bagian tubuh memanjang di kepala mirip joran dengan umpan bola kecil bisa menyala. Alat ini digunakan untuk menarik mangsa di kegelapan. Pada 2014, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) berhasil merekam penampakan ikan setan laut hitam untuk pertama kalinya. Meski terlihat menakutkan dengan gigi berduri melapisi mulutnya yang menganga, ikan ini hanya berukuran sekitar 20 centimeter saja. Jadi enggak besar kok, gaes. Dengan panjang 15 centimeter, ikan naga ( ) memiliki rahang besar mirip Venom di film Marvel. Rahang mereka mampu memanjang dan membuka melebihi kemampuan rahang ikan pada umumnya. Rahang dan mulutnya dilapisi dengan puluhan gigi taring yang tajam. Ini adalah makhluk hidup terdalam dari semua gurita. Dia adalah dumbo, bergerak dengan cara mengepakkan sirip seperti telinga dan menggunakan lengannya sebagai dayung. Mereka telah beradaptasi di lingkungan yang ekstrem dengan menjadi oportunis terakhir, karena betina akan membawa telurnya dalam berbagai tahap perkembangan. Ini artinya, jika mereka kawin, betina bisa menyimpan sperma jantan sampai kondisi lingkungan menguntungkan untuk menghasilkan keturunan. Barreleye punya bentuk fisik lumayan aneh, ia memiliki mata petet berbentuk tabung dengan kepala transparan. Mata tabung barreleye dapat berputar di dalam batok transparan yang menutupi kepalanya, memungkinkan mereka mengintai mangsa potensial atau fokus ke depan untuk melihat apa yang akan ia makan. Mata barreleye tidak hanya terlihat aneh, tetapi juga berwarna hijau. Menurut peneliti warna hijau membantu ikan menyaring sinar matahari dari permukaan. Ini juga kemungkinan membantu mereka untuk melihat cahaya bioluminescent mangsanya. Mereka menggunakan mata tubular ultra-sensitif untuk mencari siluet samar mangsa di atas kepalanya. Mata barreleye yang berbentuk tabung membuat mereka memiliki jarak pandang yang cukup sempit. Tapi uniknya, mata mereka bisa berputar. Hal inilah yang membuat ahli biologi kelautan percaya bahwa mata barreleye bisa melirik ke atas untuk melihat bayangan samar mangsa potensial, kemudian mengarahkan matanya ke depan saat ia perlahan naik untuk menemui korbannya.</td>\n",

Dua hari kemudian, saksi menceritakan apa yang ia lihat ke salah satu guru di SD tersebut. Lalu, salah satu guru SD itu memanggil seluruh siswa dan menanyakan apakah pelaku pernah memegang anggota tubuh mereka. \"Setelah itu semua siswa perempuan mengatakan pernah terlapor memegang tangan dan merangkul. Karena saat itu sudah saatnya jam pulang akhirnya saksi memulangkan para siswanya,\" jelas Devi. Usai guru itu menanyakan ke para murid perempuan, salah seorang siswi tiba-tiba mendekatinya dan memberi tahu bahwa pelaku juga pernah memegang payudaranya. Bahkan, pelaku juga pernah memperlihatkan video porno kepada siswi itu saat perjalanan dari RTH usai kegiatan olahraga. \"Selanjutnya anak korban juga menjelaskan bahwa teman lainnya juga jadi korban,\" terangnya. Devi mengungkapkan, sejumlah siswi juga pernah menjadi korban dari AR. Pada Minggu (13/4), para orang tua korban bersepakat untuk melaporkan AR ke Satreskrim Polresta Banyuwangi atas tindakan bejatnya. Devi menuturkan, salah seorang korban juga pernah diancam oleh pelaku untuk tidak menceritakan kepada siapa-siapa. \"Anak korban mengaku telah diancam oleh terlapor dengan berkata ' ' (kamu jangan bilang ke siapa-siapa kalau saya pegang seperti ini) sehingga membuat para anak korban takut,\" tuturnya. Lebih lanjut, polisi akhirnya menangkap pelaku dan menetapkan sebagai tersangka pencabulan. \"Perkara sudah kami tindak lanjuti. Sudah dilakukan penahanan terhadap tersangka,\" ujar Devi. Atas perbuatannya, tersangka dikenakan dengan Pasal 82 ayat (1) atau ayat (2) atau ayat (4) Undang-Undang RI nomor 17 tahun 2016 tentang penetapan peraturan pemerintah pengganti Undang-Undang nomor 1 tahun 2016 tentang perubahan kedua atas Undang-Undang nomor 23 tahun 2002 tentang perlindungan anak menjadi undang-undang Jo Pasal 76E Undang-Undang RI nomor 35 Tahun 2014 tentang perubahan atas Undang-Undang nomor 23 Tahun 2002 tentang perlindungan anak.</td>\n",

Pantauan , usai ketua majelis hakim Muhammad Iman mengetuk palu sidang, terdakwa Sugeng langsung menghampiri ibundanya yang setia menunggu jalannya sidang sejak siang hingga malam sekitar pukul 20.00 WIB. Tersangka Sugeng tampak mencium kaki ibundanya dan disambut pelukan erat dari sang ibu. Sugeng juga menghampiri istrinya yang tengah hamil besar, dia mencium perut istrinya. \"Doanya saja, semoga kebenaran bisa ditegakkan dan ada keadilan untuk saya. Saya bukan pelakunya,\" kata Sugeng. Sugeng berharap dirinya dapat menyaksikan kelahiran dan mengazani anaknya yang diprediksi dalam beberapa hari ke depan akan lahir. \"Sebagai muslim, wajib bagi seorang bapak untuk mengazani anaknya yang baru lahir. Tolong berikan kesempatan saya. Karena, saya sudah kehilangan ayah dan tidak sempat melihat penguburannya karena saya ada di dalam penjara,\" ucap Sugeng. Setelahnya terdakwa Sugeng melangkah keluar ruangan sidang dan menghampiri anak lelakinya yang tengah tertidur di kursi tunggu Pengadilan Negeri Cianjur. Saat Sugeng akan meninggalkan ruang sidang dan masuk mobil tahanan, seluruh keluarga besarnya tampak haru berpisah dengannya. Dalam sidang tersebut, tim kuasa hukum terdakwa meminta Majelis Hakim agar mengabulkan permohonan peralihan ke tahanan kota. Kuasa hukum terdakwa, Martin Simanjuntak mengungkapkan seharusnya majelis hakim dapat mengabulkan permohonan peralihan menjadi tahanan kota. \"Mengingat penjaminnya merupakan orang tua korban, ayah dari Almarhum Selvi. Apalagi yang menjadi pertimbangan majelis hakim untuk tidak mengabulkan permohonan tersebut,\" pungkas Martin.</td>\n",

Ketika bertemu momentum puasa, ini menjadi faktor penguat ada proses untuk terlibat politik yaitu dengan pola-pola yang sifatnya keagamaan, kata Pengamat pemilu dari CM (Cak Masykur) Management, Masykurudin Hafidz, dalam acara diskusi dengan tema Puasa Memberantas Pelanggaran Pemilu secara virtual, pada Jumat (17/3). Karena di dalam proses puasa itu ada anjuran-anjuran yang kalau dilakukan itu mendapat pahala yang berlipat, misal zakat, shodaqoh, memberi hidangan buka puasa, sambungnya. Masykur menilai, pada momentum-momentum seperti bulan puasa ini menjadi potensi terjadinya kerawanan pelanggaran Pemilu. Yakni politik terselubung atau politik uang masuk. Itu yang kami sebut peserta akan melakukan kampanye di luar masa kampanye dengan narasi-narasi keagamaan yang kuat. Ada banyak aktor politik yang menyebut bahkan narasi keagamaan jadi basis politiknya, ungkapnya. Lebih jauh, Masykur juga meminta agar Bawaslu sebagai badan pengawas lebih peka terhadap modus-modus kampanye di luar jadwal seharusnya. Hal ini bisa saja digunakan oleh segelintir oknum peserta Pemilu. Tindakan ini bila dibiarkan, maka orang yang diuntungkan adalah orang yang memiliki dana besar. Di situlah mulainya ketidakadilan, ucap mantan Kornas Jaringan Pendidikan Pemilih untuk Rakyat (JPPR) ini. Bawaslu harus melakukan penindakan, bukan dibiarkan. Tetap harus diproses, karena jelas, orang yang berkampanye di luar masa kampanye harus ditindak, tandas dia.\",\n          \"Pemerintahan Kota Medan menyediakan 7 nomor layanan pengaduan bagi para pekerja yang mengalami kendala dalam mendapatkan Tunjangan Hari Raya (THR) Lebaran. Kepala Dinas Ketenagakerjaan Medan, Illyan Chandra Simbolon menjelaskan, dengan adanya nomor layanan tersebut diharapkan dapat membantu pekerja mendapatkan THR sesuai dengan perundangan yang berlaku. Ketujuh call center ini buka selama 24 jam dan setiap pengaduan segera ditindaklanjuti oleh petugas. Itu semua nomor pegawai Disnaker yang bertugas untuk memastikan pemberian THR kepada pekerja berjalan dengan lancar dan baik, kata Illyan, Senin (10/4). Jika satu nomor tidak menanggapi, bisa hubungi nomor lain. Artinya, dengan 7 nomor layanan ini kita berharap pekerja yang mengalami masalah dapat dengan mudah menyampaikan pengaduannya, serta tidak terbatas oleh ruang dan waktu, sambung dia. Chandra mengatakan, pembukaan call center ini juga merupakan tindak lanjut dari Surat Menteri Ketenagakerjaan yang meminta daerah membuka posko pengaduan THR. 082166765529 an Marisi Sumatri Sinaga

              "0  TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Anggota Komisi VII DPR RI Rofik Hananto menyayangkan terjadinya insiden kebakaran yang disebabkan oleh bocornya depo Plumpang, Jakarta Utara, pada Jumat, 3 Maret 2023.\"Turut berbela sungkawa terhadap masyarakat sipil yang terdampak, apalagi ini daerah padat penduduk. Pertamina harus tanggung jawab,\" kata dia dalam keterangan di Jakarta Sabtu, 4 Maret 2024.Rofik mengatakan Pertamina serta pihak terkait harus memastikan keselamatan dan keamanan warga yang tinggal di sekitar lokasi.Pipa BBM yang terbakar itu merupakan bagian dari Terminal Bahan Bakar Minyak (TBBM) Plumpang. TBBM Plumpang dinilai sebagai salah satu terminal BBM terpenting di Indonesia, sehingga Rofik juga menegaskan Pertamina harus memastikan pasokan bahan bakar minyak tetap aman meski ada insiden tersebut.\"Plumpang menyuplai sekitar 20 persen kebutuhan BBM harian di Indonesia, atau sekitar 25 persen dari total kebutuhan SPBU Pertamina. Maka tindakan selanjutnya adalah bagaimana memastikan suplai BBM tidak terganggu,\" katanya.Rofik juga menyinggung kejadian kilang minyak milik Pertamina yang sebelumnya pernah terjadi kejadian serupa, seperti Kilang Balikpapan pada Maret 2022 lalu. Terhitung 2 tahun terakhir ini, kata dia, sudah 5 fasilitas migas milik Pertamina mengalami insiden kebakaran.\"Menyayangkan terjadinya musibah kebakaran ini, apalagi insiden kebakaran bukan kali pertama di fasilitas migas, ini terus berulang. Pertamina harus benahi sistem pengamanan dan SOP yang ada,\" kata dia.Rofik mengharapkan adanya pembenahan menyeluruh terhadap sistem pengamanan serta SOP yang ada dalam lingkup Pertamina untuk mengamankan baik fasilitas migas, pekerja, maupun masyarakat sekitar. Menurutnya pembenahan diperlukan agar Pertamina tidak abai terhadap aspek pengamanan fasilitas migas.\"Investigasi menyeluruh dan tuntas, serta meminta komitmen Pertamina memperbaiki sistem keamanan kilang minyak maupun depo BBM, seringnya kebakaran terjadi mengindikasikan Pertamina abai terhadap pengamanan kilang,\" ujarnya.Pilihan Editor:Profil Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Pemasok 20 Persen Pasokan BBM di Seluruh Indonesia   \n",

              "      <td>TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Anggota Komisi VII DPR RI Rofik Hananto menyayangkan terjadinya insiden kebakaran yang disebabkan oleh bocornya depo Plumpang, Jakarta Utara, pada Jumat, 3 Maret 2023.\"Turut berbela sungkawa terhadap masyarakat sipil yang terdampak, apalagi ini daerah padat penduduk. Pertamina harus tanggung jawab,\" kata dia dalam keterangan di Jakarta Sabtu, 4 Maret 2024.Rofik mengatakan Pertamina serta pihak terkait harus memastikan keselamatan dan keamanan warga yang tinggal di sekitar lokasi.Pipa BBM yang terbakar itu merupakan bagian dari Terminal Bahan Bakar Minyak (TBBM) Plumpang. TBBM Plumpang dinilai sebagai salah satu terminal BBM terpenting di Indonesia, sehingga Rofik juga menegaskan Pertamina harus memastikan pasokan bahan bakar minyak tetap aman meski ada insiden tersebut.\"Plumpang menyuplai sekitar 20 persen kebutuhan BBM harian di Indonesia, atau sekitar 25 persen dari total kebutuhan SPBU Pertamina. Maka tindakan selanjutnya adalah bagaimana memastikan suplai BBM tidak terganggu,\" katanya.Rofik juga menyinggung kejadian kilang minyak milik Pertamina yang sebelumnya pernah terjadi kejadian serupa, seperti Kilang Balikpapan pada Maret 2022 lalu. Terhitung 2 tahun terakhir ini, kata dia, sudah 5 fasilitas migas milik Pertamina mengalami insiden kebakaran.\"Menyayangkan terjadinya musibah kebakaran ini, apalagi insiden kebakaran bukan kali pertama di fasilitas migas, ini terus berulang. Pertamina harus benahi sistem pengamanan dan SOP yang ada,\" kata dia.Rofik mengharapkan adanya pembenahan menyeluruh terhadap sistem pengamanan serta SOP yang ada dalam lingkup Pertamina untuk mengamankan baik fasilitas migas, pekerja, maupun masyarakat sekitar. Menurutnya pembenahan diperlukan agar Pertamina tidak abai terhadap aspek pengamanan fasilitas migas.\"Investigasi menyeluruh dan tuntas, serta meminta komitmen Pertamina memperbaiki sistem keamanan kilang minyak maupun depo BBM, seringnya kebakaran terjadi mengindikasikan Pertamina abai terhadap pengamanan kilang,\" ujarnya.Pilihan Editor:Profil Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Pemasok 20 Persen Pasokan BBM di Seluruh Indonesia</td>\n",

Pertamina harus tanggung jawab,\\\" kata dia dalam keterangan di Jakarta Sabtu, 4 Maret 2024.Rofik mengatakan Pertamina serta pihak terkait harus memastikan keselamatan dan keamanan warga yang tinggal di sekitar lokasi.Pipa BBM yang terbakar itu merupakan bagian dari Terminal Bahan Bakar Minyak (TBBM) Plumpang. TBBM Plumpang dinilai sebagai salah satu terminal BBM terpenting di Indonesia, sehingga Rofik juga menegaskan Pertamina harus memastikan pasokan bahan bakar minyak tetap aman meski ada insiden tersebut.\\\"Plumpang menyuplai sekitar 20 persen kebutuhan BBM harian di Indonesia, atau sekitar 25 persen dari total kebutuhan SPBU Pertamina. Maka tindakan selanjutnya adalah bagaimana memastikan suplai BBM tidak terganggu,\\\" katanya.Rofik juga menyinggung kejadian kilang minyak milik Pertamina yang sebelumnya pernah terjadi kejadian serupa, seperti Kilang Balikpapan pada Maret 2022 lalu. Terhitung 2 tahun terakhir ini, kata dia, sudah 5 fasilitas migas milik Pertamina mengalami insiden kebakaran.\\\"Menyayangkan terjadinya musibah kebakaran ini, apalagi insiden kebakaran bukan kali pertama di fasilitas migas, ini terus berulang. Pertamina harus benahi sistem pengamanan dan SOP yang ada,\\\" kata dia.Rofik mengharapkan adanya pembenahan menyeluruh terhadap sistem pengamanan serta SOP yang ada dalam lingkup Pertamina untuk mengamankan baik fasilitas migas, pekerja, maupun masyarakat sekitar. Menurutnya pembenahan diperlukan agar Pertamina tidak abai terhadap aspek pengamanan fasilitas migas.\\\"Investigasi menyeluruh dan tuntas, serta meminta komitmen Pertamina memperbaiki sistem keamanan kilang minyak maupun depo BBM, seringnya kebakaran terjadi mengindikasikan Pertamina abai terhadap pengamanan kilang,\\\" ujarnya.Pilihan Editor:Profil Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Pemasok 20 Persen

              "0  TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Anggota Komisi VII DPR RI Rofik Hananto menyayangkan terjadinya insiden kebakaran yang disebabkan oleh bocornya depo Plumpang, Jakarta Utara, pada Jumat, 3 Maret 2023.\"Turut berbela sungkawa terhadap masyarakat sipil yang terdampak, apalagi ini daerah padat penduduk. Pertamina harus tanggung jawab,\" kata dia dalam keterangan di Jakarta Sabtu, 4 Maret 2024.Rofik mengatakan Pertamina serta pihak terkait harus memastikan keselamatan dan keamanan warga yang tinggal di sekitar lokasi.Pipa BBM yang terbakar itu merupakan bagian dari Terminal Bahan Bakar Minyak (TBBM) Plumpang. TBBM Plumpang dinilai sebagai salah satu terminal BBM terpenting di Indonesia, sehingga Rofik juga menegaskan Pertamina harus memastikan pasokan bahan bakar minyak tetap aman meski ada insiden tersebut.\"Plumpang menyuplai sekitar 20 persen kebutuhan BBM harian di Indonesia, atau sekitar 25 persen dari total kebutuhan SPBU Pertamina. Maka tindakan selanjutnya adalah bagaimana memastikan suplai BBM tidak terganggu,\" katanya.Rofik juga menyinggung kejadian kilang minyak milik Pertamina yang sebelumnya pernah terjadi kejadian serupa, seperti Kilang Balikpapan pada Maret 2022 lalu. Terhitung 2 tahun terakhir ini, kata dia, sudah 5 fasilitas migas milik Pertamina mengalami insiden kebakaran.\"Menyayangkan terjadinya musibah kebakaran ini, apalagi insiden kebakaran bukan kali pertama di fasilitas migas, ini terus berulang. Pertamina harus benahi sistem pengamanan dan SOP yang ada,\" kata dia.Rofik mengharapkan adanya pembenahan menyeluruh terhadap sistem pengamanan serta SOP yang ada dalam lingkup Pertamina untuk mengamankan baik fasilitas migas, pekerja, maupun masyarakat sekitar. Menurutnya pembenahan diperlukan agar Pertamina tidak abai terhadap aspek pengamanan fasilitas migas.\"Investigasi menyeluruh dan tuntas, serta meminta komitmen Pertamina memperbaiki sistem keamanan kilang minyak maupun depo BBM, seringnya kebakaran terjadi mengindikasikan Pertamina abai terhadap pengamanan kilang,\" ujarnya.Pilihan Editor:Profil Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Pemasok 20 Persen Pasokan BBM di Seluruh Indonesia   \n",

              "      <td>TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Anggota Komisi VII DPR RI Rofik Hananto menyayangkan terjadinya insiden kebakaran yang disebabkan oleh bocornya depo Plumpang, Jakarta Utara, pada Jumat, 3 Maret 2023.\"Turut berbela sungkawa terhadap masyarakat sipil yang terdampak, apalagi ini daerah padat penduduk. Pertamina harus tanggung jawab,\" kata dia dalam keterangan di Jakarta Sabtu, 4 Maret 2024.Rofik mengatakan Pertamina serta pihak terkait harus memastikan keselamatan dan keamanan warga yang tinggal di sekitar lokasi.Pipa BBM yang terbakar itu merupakan bagian dari Terminal Bahan Bakar Minyak (TBBM) Plumpang. TBBM Plumpang dinilai sebagai salah satu terminal BBM terpenting di Indonesia, sehingga Rofik juga menegaskan Pertamina harus memastikan pasokan bahan bakar minyak tetap aman meski ada insiden tersebut.\"Plumpang menyuplai sekitar 20 persen kebutuhan BBM harian di Indonesia, atau sekitar 25 persen dari total kebutuhan SPBU Pertamina. Maka tindakan selanjutnya adalah bagaimana memastikan suplai BBM tidak terganggu,\" katanya.Rofik juga menyinggung kejadian kilang minyak milik Pertamina yang sebelumnya pernah terjadi kejadian serupa, seperti Kilang Balikpapan pada Maret 2022 lalu. Terhitung 2 tahun terakhir ini, kata dia, sudah 5 fasilitas migas milik Pertamina mengalami insiden kebakaran.\"Menyayangkan terjadinya musibah kebakaran ini, apalagi insiden kebakaran bukan kali pertama di fasilitas migas, ini terus berulang. Pertamina harus benahi sistem pengamanan dan SOP yang ada,\" kata dia.Rofik mengharapkan adanya pembenahan menyeluruh terhadap sistem pengamanan serta SOP yang ada dalam lingkup Pertamina untuk mengamankan baik fasilitas migas, pekerja, maupun masyarakat sekitar. Menurutnya pembenahan diperlukan agar Pertamina tidak abai terhadap aspek pengamanan fasilitas migas.\"Investigasi menyeluruh dan tuntas, serta meminta komitmen Pertamina memperbaiki sistem keamanan kilang minyak maupun depo BBM, seringnya kebakaran terjadi mengindikasikan Pertamina abai terhadap pengamanan kilang,\" ujarnya.Pilihan Editor:Profil Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Pemasok 20 Persen Pasokan BBM di Seluruh Indonesia</td>\n",

Pertamina harus tanggung jawab,\\\" kata dia dalam keterangan di Jakarta Sabtu, 4 Maret 2024.Rofik mengatakan Pertamina serta pihak terkait harus memastikan keselamatan dan keamanan warga yang tinggal di sekitar lokasi.Pipa BBM yang terbakar itu merupakan bagian dari Terminal Bahan Bakar Minyak (TBBM) Plumpang. TBBM Plumpang dinilai sebagai salah satu terminal BBM terpenting di Indonesia, sehingga Rofik juga menegaskan Pertamina harus memastikan pasokan bahan bakar minyak tetap aman meski ada insiden tersebut.\\\"Plumpang menyuplai sekitar 20 persen kebutuhan BBM harian di Indonesia, atau sekitar 25 persen dari total kebutuhan SPBU Pertamina. Maka tindakan selanjutnya adalah bagaimana memastikan suplai BBM tidak terganggu,\\\" katanya.Rofik juga menyinggung kejadian kilang minyak milik Pertamina yang sebelumnya pernah terjadi kejadian serupa, seperti Kilang Balikpapan pada Maret 2022 lalu. Terhitung 2 tahun terakhir ini, kata dia, sudah 5 fasilitas migas milik Pertamina mengalami insiden kebakaran.\\\"Menyayangkan terjadinya musibah kebakaran ini, apalagi insiden kebakaran bukan kali pertama di fasilitas migas, ini terus berulang. Pertamina harus benahi sistem pengamanan dan SOP yang ada,\\\" kata dia.Rofik mengharapkan adanya pembenahan menyeluruh terhadap sistem pengamanan serta SOP yang ada dalam lingkup Pertamina untuk mengamankan baik fasilitas migas, pekerja, maupun masyarakat sekitar. Menurutnya pembenahan diperlukan agar Pertamina tidak abai terhadap aspek pengamanan fasilitas migas.\\\"Investigasi menyeluruh dan tuntas, serta meminta komitmen Pertamina memperbaiki sistem keamanan kilang minyak maupun depo BBM, seringnya kebakaran terjadi mengindikasikan Pertamina abai terhadap pengamanan kilang,\\\" ujarnya.Pilihan Editor:Profil Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Pemasok 20 Persen

              "29092  JAKARTA - PT Trimegah Karya Pratama Tbk (UVCR) atau Ultra Voucher mencatatkan laba bersih Rp11,88 miliar atau naik 113,30% dari sebelumnya sebesar Rp5,57 miliar. Di samping itu, angka penjualan perseroan juga naik 30,12% menjadi Rp1,22 triliun, dari sebelumnya sebesar Rp939,20 miliar. Kenaikan penjualan UVCR ditopang oleh penjualan voucher digital dan fisik sebesar Rp1,2 triliun baik di aplikasi Ultra Voucher, B2B dan e-commerce.  Kemudian, sebesar Rp1,9 miliar dikontribusikan oleh transaksi biller, serta sebesar Rp1,6 miliar berasal dari pendapatan lainnya. Direktur Utama UVCR Hady Kuswanto menyampaikan, pertumbuhan kinerja perseroan didasari oleh sinergi dan ekspansi bisnis yang dilakukan. Adapun, sinergi dan ekspansi bisnis tersebut dilakukan tidak hanya berdasarkan wilayah, namun juga terhadap teknologi yang digunakan di seluruh lini produk dan jasa perseroan sehingga menghasilkan solusi yang dapat diaplikasikan oleh seluruh pihak. Pencapaian kinerja tahun 2022 didukung oleh adaptasi cepat kami dalam melihat momentum masyarakat, untuk menggunakan voucher sebagai sarana pemenuhan kebutuhan masyarakat, kata Hady dalam keterangan resminya, Kamis (6/4/2023). Hady menjelaskan, adaptasi yang dilakukan oleh perseroan tidak terbatas hanya kepada individu, melainkan secara universal. Di mana, solusi perseroan dapat mendukung pertumbuhan dari berbagai perusahaan terhadap kebutuhan voucher, katalog, hingga loyalti. Menurut dia, solusi yang diberikan UVCR sebagai perusahaan teknologi bersifat universal. Pasalnya, produk dan jasa perseroan dapat digunakan langsung oleh pengguna melalui aplikasi, e-commerce, dan gift card. Kami juga memiliki corporate solution untuk membantu perusahaan lainnya bertumbuh dan memiliki fitur voucher, katalog dan loyalty engine, imbuh dia.

Ada sebuah kisah humor yang pernah dia ceritakan mengenai orang Jawa dan Sunda yang bertemu.  \"Orang sunda di Stasiun Cirebon lama nunggu di depan WC, atau kakus,\" cerita Gus Dur, dikutip dari Youtube Maarif NU Jateng. Lalu, pintu WC itu akhirnya dibuka. Orangnya keluar dari dalam toilet tersebut sembari merapihkan celana. \"Atos?\" tanya si orang Sunda. Gus Dur menjelaskan, orang Sunda kan bahasanya halus. Di mana atos yang dimaksud itu berarti \"sudah\". Tetapi, si orang Jawa itu malah salah paham. \"Atos atos, orang mencret kok!\" cerita Gus Dur sambil tertawa terbahak-bahak.

Di samping itu, angka penjualan perseroan juga naik 30,12% menjadi Rp1,22 triliun, dari sebelumnya sebesar Rp939,20 miliar. Kenaikan penjualan UVCR ditopang oleh penjualan voucher digital dan fisik sebesar Rp1,2 triliun baik di aplikasi Ultra Voucher, B2B dan e-commerce.  Kemudian, sebesar Rp1,9 miliar dikontribusikan oleh transaksi biller, serta sebesar Rp1,6 miliar berasal dari pendapatan lainnya. Direktur Utama UVCR Hady Kuswanto menyampaikan, pertumbuhan kinerja perseroan didasari oleh sinergi dan ekspansi bisnis yang dilakukan. Adapun, sinergi dan ekspansi bisnis tersebut dilakukan tidak hanya berdasarkan wilayah, namun juga terhadap teknologi yang digunakan di seluruh lini produk dan jasa perseroan sehingga menghasilkan solusi yang dapat diaplikasikan oleh seluruh pihak. Pencapaian kinerja tahun 2022 didukung oleh adaptasi cepat kami dalam melihat momentum masyarakat, untuk menggunakan voucher sebagai sarana pemenuhan kebutuhan masyarakat, kata Hady dalam keterangan resminya, Kamis (6/4/2023). Hady menjelaskan, adaptasi yang dilakukan oleh perseroan tidak terbatas hanya kepada individu, melainkan secara universal. Di mana, solusi perseroan dapat mendukung pertumbuhan dari berbagai perusahaan terhadap kebutuhan voucher, katalog, hingga loyalti. Menurut dia, solusi yang diberikan UVCR sebagai perusahaan teknologi bersifat universal. Pasalnya, produk dan jasa perseroan dapat digunakan langsung oleh pengguna melalui aplikasi, e-commerce, dan gift card. Kami juga memiliki corporate solution untuk membantu perusahaan lainnya bertumbuh dan memiliki fitur voucher, katalog dan loyalty engine, imbuh dia.

Hal itu disampaikannya saat menghadiri sosialisasi Program Indonesia Pintar (PIP), di Hotel Transera Pontianak, Senin 13 Maret 2023. \\\"Bagi anak dari kalangan keluarga tidak mampu, tidak ada alasan untuk tidak bersekolah sehingga program PKH yang kita perjuangkan melalui Kementerian Sosial itu juga sudah berjalan. Demikian juga program beasiswa bagi anak tidak mampu juga kita upayakan,\\\" ujarnya Edi menjelaskan, pemerintah menggulirkan PIP untuk membantu anak-anak usia sekolah dari keluarga prasejahtera agar tetap bersekolah. Ia menyebut di Kota Pontianak, hanya tinggal bagaimana program ini dioptimalkan dengan menggali potensi sumber daya yang ada. \\\"Sejauh ini, kita senantiasa memberikan ruang kepada masyarakat Kota Pontianak untuk bisa mendapatkan akses pendidikan,\\\" ungkapnya. Ia menilai bahwa aksesibilitas yang ada di Kota Pontianak hampir semuanya sudah terlayani, baik dari sisi jumlah sekolah yang ada maupun dari aksesibilitas, jarak dan fasilitas lainnya. Oleh sebab itu dia berharap PIP ini, khususnya di Kota Pontianak, bisa berjalan lancar karena ini menjadi bagian dari tugas wajib yang harus dikerjakan dan optimalkan oleh Pemkot Pontianak. \\\"Saya berharap melalui sosialisasi PIP ini bisa memberikan pemahaman dan persepsi yang sama untuk berupaya mencari informasi dan data anak-anak dari kalangan tidak mampu, baik dari Dinas Sosial Kota Pontianak maupun langsung dari lingkungan sekitar sehingga tidak ada lagi anak yang putus sekolah,\\\" terangnya. \\\"Harapannya, tidak ada lagi anak-anak yang tidak bersekolah di Kota Pontianak,\\\" harap Edi. Sementara itu, Kepala Dinas Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Kota Pontianak Sri Sujiharti menerangkan, menambahkan PIP diselenggarakan dalam rangka membantu anak-anak usia sekolah dari keluarga prasejahtera atau rentan kemiskinan supaya tetap mendapatkan layanan pendidikan hingga tamat pendidikan menengah. Baik itu melalui jalur formal, SD sampai SMA/SMK dan jalur non formal Paket A sampai dengan Paket C dan pendidikan khusus. \\\"Melalui program ini pemerintah berupaya mencegah peserta didik dari kemungkinan putus sekolah dan diharapkan dapat menarik siswa putus sekolah agar kembali melanjutkan pendidikannya,\\\" terangnya. Sri juga menambahkan, PIP diharapkan dapat meringankan biaya personal pendidikan peserta didik, baik biaya langsung maupun tidak langsung. Dalam waktu dekat pencairan PIP untuk tahun 2023 sudah akan dilaksanakan. \\\"Oleh sebab itu perlu bagi kita untuk segera mempersiapkan diri terutama di lingkungan sekolah, baik SD, SMP dan instansi terkait lainnya,\\\" pungkasnya.\",\n          \"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Menteri Pariwisata dan Ekonomi Kreatif Sandiaga Uno menyebut sudah ada dua investor besar yang tertarik membangun hotel bintang 5 di kawasan Danau Toba. Saat ini, fasilitas penginapan hotel bintang 5 memang belum tersedia di kawasan wisata tersebut.Sudah menghubungi kami dan saat ini sedang kami tindak lanjuti, ujar Sandiaga ketika ditemui di Kantor Kemenparekraf, Senin, 13 Maret 2023. Satu (calon investor) dari China dan satu lagi dari dalam negeri, imbuhnya.Sandiaga menjelaskan, ketertarikan itu disampaikan ketika dia melakukan kunjungan kerja ke Hong Kong. Danau Toba memang menjadi salah satu destinasi yang kami tawarkan untuk para investor, ucapnya.Rencananya, pembangunan hotel tersebut akan dilakukan di Balige. Namun karena keterbatasan lahan, Sandiaga mengatakan, pembangunan mengarah ke wilayah Kaldera yang jarak tempuhnya kurang lebih 45 menit dari Balige.Sebelumnya, Menteri Koordinator Bidang Kemaritiman dan Investasi Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan melarang pembangunan hotel bintang tiga di Danau Toba. Sandiaga menjelaskan, larangan tersebut disampaikan karena sudah ada sejumlah homestay dan hotel setara bintang 3 yang beroperasi di kawasan tersebut.Karena itu, kawasan Danau Toba membutuhkan akomodasi yang lebih dari itu. Apalagi kami ingin menggagas beberapa event berskala internasional. Hotel bintang lima menjadi keharusan, kata Sandiaga, Senin, 27 Februari 2023.Pilihan Editor:PT Pupuk Indonesia Bakal Pasang Chip di Karung Pupuk, Apa Sebabnya?Ikuti berita terkini dari Tempo di Google News, klik disini\",\n          \"JAKARTA - Kementerian Perdagangan memusnahkan 730 bal pakaian, sepatu, dan tas bekas yang diduga dari impor. Nilainya pun sangat besar yakni Rp10 miliar. Pemusnahan itu dilakukan di Terminal Tipe A Bandar Raya Payung Sekaki di Pekanbaru, Riau, hari ini.  \\\"Sebagai respons dan salah satu tanggung jawab kami atas semakin maraknya perdagangan pakaian bekas, alas kaki, dan tas asal impor yang tidak sesuai ketentuan, kami melakukan pemusnahan sebanyak 730 bal pakaian, alas kaki, dan tas bekas dengan nilai mencapai Rp10 miliar. Hal ini merupakan tindak lanjut pengawasan terhadap perdagangan dan impor pakaian bekas yang kami lakukan secara berkelanjutan,\\\" ujar Menteri Perdagangan (Mendag) Zulkifli Hasan, dikutip dari Antara, di Jakarta, Jumat (17/3/2023). Pemusnahan ini merupakan salah satu bentuk komitmen Kementerian Perdagangan (Kemendag) dalam proses pengawasan dan penegakan hukum terkait dengan pelanggaran di bidang perdagangan dan perlindungan konsumen. Pemusnahan ini merupakan langkah nyata Kemendag dalam menindaklanjuti arahan Presiden Joko Widodo pada Rabu (15/3) dalam pembukaan Business Matching Produk Dalam Negeri yang mengecam impor pakaian bekas karena telah mengganggu industri dalam negeri. \\\"Arahan presiden sangat tegas agar industri dalam negeri dan UMKM ini dijaga dan harus dilindungi dari serbuan pakaian bekas, alas kaki, dan tas bekas asal impor. Kemendag secara rutin memantau dan mengawasi peredaran pakaian bekas ini dan melakukan penegakan hukum dengan memusnahkannya,\\\" kata Mendag. Mendag menegaskan bahwa pakaian, sepatu, dan tas bekas merupakan barang yang dilarang impornya berdasarkan Peraturan Menteri Perdagangan Nomor 18 Tahun 2021 sebagaimana telah diubah dengan Peraturan Menteri Perdagangan Nomor 40 Tahun 2022 tentang Perubahan Atas Peraturan Menteri Perdagangan Nomor 18 Tahun 2021 Tentang Barang Dilarang Ekspor dan Barang Dilarang Impor. Selain penegakan hukum, langkah edukasi dan sosialisasi penggunaan produk dalam negeri juga dilakukan. Mendag berharap, konsumen lebih mengutamakan beli pakaian baru hasil industri dalam negeri dan usaha mikro kecil dan menengah (UMKM).  Baca Juga:  Ketahui Kerugian Membeli Mobil Bekas Banjir Menurutnya, produk dalam negeri tidak kalah baiknya dengan produk impor baik dari sisi mutu maupun tren. Tingginya penggunaan produk dalam negeri juga bisa menekan peredaran pakaian bekas. \\\"Kami mengimbau masyarakat Indonesia untuk bangga menggunakan produk dalam negeri demi menjaga harkat dan martabat bangsa. Dengan menghindari penggunaan pakaian bekas asal impor, konsumen dapat terhindar dari dampak buruk pakaian bekas dalam jangka panjang dan sekaligus turut serta memperkuat industri dalam negeri dan UMKM,\\\" ujar Mendag. Sementara itu, Plt. Direktur Jenderal Perlindungan Konsumen dan Tertib Niaga (PKTN) Moga Simatupang mengungkapkan, dari hasil pengembangan sementara, ditengarai pakaian, sepatu dan tas bekas tersebut diperoleh dari pemasok yang berlokasi di Batam. \\\"Saat ini kami masih melakukan pengumpulan bahan keterangan lebih lanjut terkait proses dan jalur masuk pakaian bekas tersebut ke Indonesia,\\\" ujar Moga. Menurut dia, diperlukan sinergi seluruh Kementerian/Lembaga terkait dalam pengawasan terhadap barang-barang yang dilarang impornya karena tugas tersebut tidak hanya menjadi tanggung jawab Kementerian Perdagangan saja namun melibatkan seluruh pihak. \\\"Saya minta hentikan praktik jual beli barang-barang bekas asal impor di wilayah NKRI, karena komitmen PKTN dan seluruh instansi terkait hal ini adalah akan menindak dengan tegas dan memusnahkannya,\\\" kata Moga.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20661,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Indeks Harga Saham Gabungan (IHSG) naik 1,37 persen ke level 6.655,718, didukung oleh sektor saham perbankan khususnya BUMN yang naik sekitar 2 persen.
